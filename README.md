1. **MoodBot Chatbot** 

A rule-based chatbot with mood detection and real-time weather/news using APIs. Built as part of the **CodSoft Internship**.

 Features
- Rule-based responses using if-else
- Detects user mood (happy, sad, angry)
- Fetches real-time weather from OpenWeatherMap API
- Fetches top news from NewsAPI

 Tech Used
- Python
- Requests library
- OpenWeatherMap API
- NewsAPI**
2. **An interactive recommendation system that:**
- Asks the user for their favorite genre
- Lets them choose between Movies or Books
- Displays 10 suggestions with posters and brief descriptions

Built using:
- Python
- Google Colab
- Content-based Filtering

3.**Build an AI agent that never loses in Tic-Tac-Toe**
 Features

- 3Ã—3 Tic-Tac-Toe board in console
- Human plays as X, AI plays as O
- AI uses Minimax algorithm to always make the best move
- Detects win, loss, or draw
  
4.**Image Captioning AI with CNN + LSTM**

This project implements an Image Captioning system that combines **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The system uses a pre-trained CNN (ResNet50) for extracting image features and a simple RNN-based decoder (LSTM) for generating captions.

Features

- Uses **ResNet50** (pre-trained on ImageNet) to extract deep features from input images.
- Uses **LSTM** to generate meaningful English captions from image features.
- Simple implementation designed to run in **Google Colab**.
- Demonstrates a basic pipeline for combining **vision and language** tasks.

5. **Face Detection and Recognition AI (OpenCV + DeepFace)**
This project demonstrates an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images using:
- Haar Cascades (OpenCV) for Face Detection
- DeepFace (pre-trained deep learning models) for Face Recognition, Emotion, Age & Gender analysis

 Features
-Face Detection using OpenCV's Haar cascades
-  Face Recognition using DeepFace (ArcFace, VGG-Face, Facenet)
-  Emotion, Age, Gender prediction
-  Works on any uploaded image

Technologies Used:
 OpenCV Haar Cascades 
 DeepFace                       
 Google Colab
