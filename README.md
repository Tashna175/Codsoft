- Detects user mood (happy, sad, angry)
- Fetches real-time weather from OpenWeatherMap API
- Fetches top news from NewsAPI

 Tech Used
- Python
- Requests library
- OpenWeatherMap API
- NewsAPI**
2. **An interactive recommendation system that:**
- Asks the user for their favorite genre
- Lets them choose between Movies or Books
- Displays 10 suggestions with posters and brief descriptions

  4.**Image Captioning AI with CNN + LSTM**

This project implements an Image Captioning system that combines **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The system uses a pre-trained CNN (ResNet50) for extracting image features and a simple RNN-based decoder (LSTM) for generating captions.

Features

- Uses **ResNet50** (pre-trained on ImageNet) to extract deep features from input images.
- Uses **LSTM** to generate meaningful English captions from image features.
- Simple implementation designed to run in **Google Colab**.
- Demonstrates a basic pipeline for combining **vision and language** tasks.
